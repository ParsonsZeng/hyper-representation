# hyper-representation
This is the official repo for the experiments in the paper "Bilevel Programming for Hyperparameter Optimization and Meta-Learning"

The code is really unpolished (sorry for this) and might be a little hard to understand so for any questions feel free to contact me or to
open an issue.
 
All the experiments were done using tensorflow 1.2.1, there are some major changes in newer releases that might make 
some things not working anymore.


## Prerequisites
you need to install [tensorflow](https://www.tensorflow.org/install/) >= 1.2.1
the package [FAR-HO](https://github.com/lucfra/FAR-HO) for hyper-parameter optimization
and [this experiment manager package](https://github.com/lucfra/ExperimentManager)

# Results Replications
To run the experiments run the main file with the appropriate arguments described in the file.
