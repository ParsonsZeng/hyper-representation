# Hyper-representation
This is the official repo for the experiments in the paper "Bilevel Programming for Hyperparameter Optimization and Meta-Learning"

__WORK IN PROGRESS__

## Prerequisites
you need to install [tensorflow](https://www.tensorflow.org/install/) >= 1.2.1
the package [Far-HO](https://github.com/lucfra/FAR-HO) for hyper-parameter optimization
and [this experiment manager package](https://github.com/lucfra/ExperimentManager)

To be sure that Far-HO version matches with the one used to run these experiments, install Far-HO from branch [final_ICML18](https://github.com/lucfra/FAR-HO/tree/final_ICML18)

## Results Replications
To replicate the experiments run `python main.py` from command line with the appropriate arguments
described in the `main.py` file.
